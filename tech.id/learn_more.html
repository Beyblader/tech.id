                <h2>What kind of future technology is?</h2>
                <p>The future is coming, and sooner than you think. These emerging technologies will change the way we live, how we look after our bodies and help us avert a climate disaster.</p>

                <p>Technology moves at a rapid pace these days. It can sometimes feel like every single day there is a new technology that is going to revolutionise the future. But with so many massive technological upgrades happening all the time, it is easy to lose track of the amazing ways the world is progressing.</p>

                <p>A team of researchers turned a dead spider into a robot-like gripper, given the ability to pick up other objects. To achieve this, they take a spider and inject it with air. This works because spiders use hydraulics to force their version of blood (haemolymph) into their limbs, making them extend.</p>
